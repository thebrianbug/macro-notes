## Overview

1. Smart contracts / programmable money is steadily rising in usage today. However, each blockchain is limited to the data available inside its ecosystem. In order to be used for more things, there needs to be a way to "bridge" or LINK data into a blockchain from outside in a way that can be guaranteed to be trustworthy. This is called the Oracle Problem.
2. LINK allows purchasers to request data. Providers bid to supply it and lock up their own money in a "stake." If the purchaser is satisfied with the quality and timeliness of the Provider, the Provider keeps their stake and they are paid the bid. If not a portion of the stake is destroyed and the global reputation of the Provider immediately suffers. Other Providers could then supply the requested data instead.
3. LINK is already one of the most depended upon projects in cryptocurrency. Most projects in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) space use LINK for external data. Almost any blockchain can increase their usefulness by integrating with secure external data through LINK.
4. LINK is supported and used by several high-profile partnerships including Google and the SWIFT banking network itself. This is the system currently used to facilitate most dollar transfers across most banks worldwide.

## Major Bullish Arguments

1. The problem that LINK provides a solution for is shared by almost every network, app, and token in all of crypto.
2. LINK is already used by most successful and/or new projects in crypto. Many of the smartest and most capable developers in the world are working either directly on LINK or integrating it with their own blockchains.
3. LINK is highly transparent both in and of itself and with its Providers and so is likely to remain a trusted data source indefinitely.

## Major Counterarguments

1. Trusting outside data from a Provider in smart contracts inherently makes blockchain less secure.
   - While this is perhaps true to some extent, it also vastly increases the total usefulness of the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. LINK creates an open market of trusted parties where honest and timely participation is rewarded similar to the game theory on-chain in most cryptocurrencies. Given a high enough fee the Providers should be adequately incentivized to supply any requested data.
2. Too few Providers can participate in the system to provide a given data request, causing a risk of undue centralization.
   - This is again mostly a question of fees. For a sufficiently high fee any number of data sources should be able to be provided for almost any data feed. In practice, it is true that many projects currently rely on relatively few Providers that may be participating in a given niche. This has been exploited in the past via several DeFi projects and so projects are becoming much more careful about using more Providers for data feeds.
