## Overview

1. The Graph (GRT) is a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying blockchain data. An index is a saved cache of data that can be used to query data much faster than searching blockchains directly. Similarly, Google creates indexes to search the web quickly. For this reason The Graph has been called "The Google of Blockchains."
1. Almost every decentralized application (dApp) built in crypto utilizes indexes to access its data. Before The Graph, almost all of these indexing solutions were custom built in-house for each blockchain/application. This costs time and is difficult to do correctly due to the complex nature of crypto. The Graph is a decentralized protocol allows companies to not need to re-implement this common work. Instead, they can use the decentralized Graph Protocol to get accurate and timely data for their blockchain of choice. Some of the largest projects have utilized The Graph in their dApps including Uniswap, Synthetics, and Aave.
1. The Graph can support data not just for the Ethereum blockchain it's implemented on, but also for arbitrary blockchains. Currently, it supports Ethereum and other popular layer-1 and layer-2 blockchains. Each different blockchain is stored on a separate "subgraph."
1. The Graph serves queries through Graph Query Language (GraphQL), which is a common standard that makes it easy for almost any developer to use even if they are not blockchain experts. Due to this and other decisions, The Graph has done a great job in making their system very easy to use by most developers.
1. The GRT token is used an an incentive for the many participants that run the system. Indexers get GRT to maintain an accurate index for the needed data. Curators get GRT to police the accuracy of the indexed data and suggest new subgraphs to index. Delegators receive GRT for signaling their trust of a particular indexer by delegating part of their GRT to them in a stake. Together, these parties make participating The Graph sustainable and economically scalable.

## Major Bullish Arguments

1. Almost every dApp needs an accurate index of blockchain data.

## Major Counterarguments

1. The token distribution for GRT happened to quickly to have allowed for sufficient decentralization of the token.

## Price Potential

## Major Risks
