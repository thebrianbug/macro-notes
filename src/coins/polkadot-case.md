## Overview

1. Polkadot (DOT) presents a fundamental redesign of blockchains and an alternative to smart-contract platforms such as Ethereum. [Gavin Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Wood){target=\_blank} is the founder of DOT and was also a co-founder and the CTO of Ethereum.
1. Wood believes the future will contain not just one dominant but many differing blockchains. This is primarily based on the observation that no matter how well a general-purpose system is built, eventually it will perform sub-optimally when compared to special-purpose systems at least for some use cases.
1. DOT's primary focus is to make interoperability between vastly differing blockchains easy. If Ethereum is a Layer-1 network for running smart contracts, DOT strives to be a Layer-0 that can glue many Layer-1 blockchains together seamlessly. The DOT protocol is like a "federal government" that can support arbitrarily many custom "state governments." The DOT protocol's Layer-0 is a "federal government" that consists of a basic "constitution" outlining how Layer-1 blockchains "states" can interact. It also defines ways that the DOT Layer-0 "constitution" can be amended by vote as needed.
1. Wood is expecting that if this common Layer-0 protocol or "constitution" is built, companies and entrepreneurs will build many special-purpose Layer-1 networks on top of DOT for different purposes. To this end, DOT also provides extensive tooling to help make designing a custom Layer-1 protocol as simple as possible for developers.
1. DOT can also connect with other blockchains that are not running as part of the DOT network. It does this through oracles that carry data back and forth between blockchains. The primary provider of Oracles for the DOT network is Chainlink.
