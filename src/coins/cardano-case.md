## Overview

1. Cardano (ADA) was developed as a smart-contract platform and an alterative to Ethereum. [Charles Hoskinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Hoskinson){target=\_blank} is the founder of ADA and was also an early founding member of ETH's team. With ADA he is working to create a new platform as an attempt to fix ETH's issues in a different way.
1. The entire team(s) on ADA is staffed by [world-class developers and academics](https://iohk.io/en/team/){target=\_blank}. ADA has arguably the single most distinguished team currently operating in cryptocurrency, which truly is an astounding accomplishment.
1. ADA has developed most of their protocol through the rigorous discipline of High-Assurance Code. This means that features begin not as code but as academic papers which are then submitted for formal academic peer review. Once there each paper is reviewed and mathematically proven for correctness as applicable. Upon passing through that, it is translated into a high-level code representation. It is then extensively tested that the code matches the paper identically. Then, various security threats are simulated and further testing is performed. Finally, the code is then translated into production-ready code and tested that it exactly matches the other two representations. Only after that point is it released for use. This ensures the most reliable software that engineering and academia can produce. By the time any feature is released it is already one of the most tested pieces of code ever produced.
1. The teams at ADA have mastered this discipline of producing High-Assurance Code at a level that is unlikely to be replicable by any other team not just in blockchain, but also across almost any other discipline. They have been through this process again and again and are becoming ever faster and better at it.
1. Because of the peer-review process, the algorithms presented in ADA are also the highest-performing that academia and engineering have yet discovered.
1. ADA made another bold technical choice to leverage functional programming languages including Haskell and their own Plutus. Plutus was created (by the author of Haskell and team) to ensure maximally reliable smart contracts. In practice this means that developers will greatly decrease the amount of bugs deployed in their code, which is essential in financial applications. It also means that it will be much easier to mathematically prove the correctness of projects built on it. These effects cannot be easily replicated in non-functional languages used on other platforms. More traditional languages are also supported for applications that don't need as high of assurance for quality.
1. ADA is including robust interoperability across blockchains as a first-class priority within the protocol itself. Much of the research for how to handle interoperability was actually created and funded through ADA's work.
1. ADA is fully open-source (the code is public) much more decentralized than some of its competitors. Additional features are on the roadmap to fulfil this ethos such as built-in governance by the community. This gives ADA the ability to upgrade without disruptive contentions common on other protocols.
1. ADA implements a public treasury through [Project Catalyst](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/09/16/project-catalyst-introducing-our-first-public-fund-for-cardano-community-innovation/){target=\_blank}. This provides funds to support improvements throughout the entire lifetime of the protocol, which is important because producing High-Assurance Code is quite an expensive process. The community votes on how to deploy the funds. The engagement of the community voting on how to deploy the funds has the most participation of its kind ever.
1. ADA has active and productive [partnerships](https://www.publish0x.com/wordstock/full-list-of-cardano-ada-partnerships-and-collaborations-202-xpgvdj){target=\_blank} with many 3rd world countries around the world. Unlike many currently in crypto, these partnerships are not just press gimmicks but case studies on solving real problems for these countries using ADA. Examples include permanently solving voter fraud, providing digital identity for unbanked individuals, facilitating accountability of international financing to underdeveloped countries.
1. Where ETH is working on ETH 2.0 to become more scalable, ADA can handle almost limitless scale. As the ADA network gains more users, it becomes even faster.
1. ADA is implemented using Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), specifically [Ouroboros](https://cardano.org/ouroboros/){target=\_blank}. Its central security model has already been extensively mathematically and practically proven to be secure given the assumption of an honest majority through the same peer-reviewed High-Assurance Code discipline. The honest majority assumption is the defining assumption behind virtually all of cryptocurrency.
1. In order to practically incentive an honest majority the game theory has been defined and created using parameters that can be easily changed over time as real life reveals which exact settings are optimal.
1. ADA is developed to make interoperability between blockchains easy. This is important as the number of blockchains continues to grow.
1. ADA has claimed and maintained a spot in the top 10 cryptocurrencies for several years and now is in the top 5.

## Major Bullish Arguments

1. ADA literally writes the standards by which the rest of cryptocurrency is measured.
1. ADA is unmatched in the technical prowess of their platform. It is a direct implementation of the best known to research in the field, most of which was funded by the project itself. Where other projects try to implement one or two breakthrough ideas from papers, ADA has developed most of its protocol via peer-reviewed paper first, producing the absolute best technical results yet known to science, engineering, and academia.
1. The personal ADA wallet is actually a full node. ADA runs so efficiently that even small hardware can run the entire blockchain on its own (or at least a view of it for itself). This means that token holders gain direct access to all ADA features including staking, without needing a computer science background. There is also no minimum staking requirement. This should lead to greater diversification of stakers and first-class participants of ADA in the long run compared with other protocols.

## Major Counterarguments

1. The High-Assurance Code process is too expensive and time-consuming to produce usable results in the real world fast enough.
   - It is true that ADA has had several delays of releases throughout its history, as has most protocols. However, with time the team in ADA has managed to deliver working functionality again and again and establish a regular release cadence. They now have over 100 peer-reviewed papers which are implemented across their entire system. They release month after month and quarter after quarter code that has passed their massive arsenal of automated tests. And, they are getting faster at the whole process each time.
1. Now that ETH exists, no other platform will be able to overtake it in adoption.
   - Companies will choose to build on the protocol that best allows them to fulfil their own goals. Today ETH has a huge problem with fees. It is working to gradually alleviate that problem. However, it is much more difficult to successfully rebuild the plane while still flying. Projects that don't need to support legacy systems yet can innovate faster than their predecessors.
1. Frequently, the project with the undisputable best technology does not become the market leader.
   - ADA is not ignoring facilitating real usage. The partnerships with 3rd world countries is leading to real usage that will be very slow to leave for any other platform. The innovation on top of ADA funded through the treasury is only getting bigger and more diverse. ADA has a solid chance to acquire real users. Unlike other platforms, when those users build on ADA they do not quickly run into the limit of what the technology can handle but instead largely have a good experience for the long term.

## Price Potential

1. ADA addresses the same market as ETH, namely it is a smart contract platform.

## Major Risks

1. Projects on ETH do not want to leave ETH unless they are left with no other choice.
