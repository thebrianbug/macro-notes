## Overview

1. Cardano (ADA) was developed as a smart-contract platform and an alterative to Ethereum. Charles Hoskinson is the founder of ADA and was also an early founding member of ETH's team. With ADA he is working to create a new platform as an attempt to fix ETH's issues in a different way.
1. ADA is fully open-source (the code is public) much more decentralized than some of its competitors. Additional features are on the roadmap to fulfil this ethos such as built-in governance by the community.
1. ADA implements a public treasury. This provides funds to support improvements throughout the entire lifetime of the protocol.
1. Where ETH is working on ETH 2.0 to become more scalable, ADA can handle super-scale. As the network gains more users, it becomes even faster.
1. ADA is implemented as a Proof of Stake (PoS) coin.
1. ADA is developed to make interoperability between blockchains easy. This is important as the number of blockchains continues to grow.
1. ADA has submitted their entire protocol to peer reviews by expert computer scientists, engineers, and mathematicians. Every aspect of the protocol is peer reviewed both as an idea and as code. This makes the occurrence of bugs within the protocol virtually non-existent compared to what is possible by other projects who don't go through such a rigorous process.
1. ADA made a bold technical choice to leverage a functional programming language called Haskell. In practice this means that developers will greatly decrease the amount of bugs deployed in their code, which is essential in financial applications. It also means that it will be much easier to mathematically prove the correctness of projects built on it. These effects cannot be easily replicated in non-functional languages supported on other platforms.
1. ADA has claimed and maintained a spot in the top 10 cryptocurrencies for several years and now is in the top 5.
