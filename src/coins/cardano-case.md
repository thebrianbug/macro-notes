## Overview

1. Cardano (ADA) was developed as a smart-contract platform and an alterative to Ethereum. The main founders took their learnings as early members of ETH's team to create a new platform as an attempt to fix ETH's issues in a different way.
1. ADA is fully open-source (the code is public) much more decentralized than many of its competitors.
1. Where ETH is working on ETH 2.0 to become more scalable, ADA is massively scalable.
1. ADA is implemented as a Proof of Stake (PoS) coin.
1. ADA leverages a functional programming language called Haskell. In practice this means that developers will greatly decrease the amount of bugs deployed in their code, which is essential in financial applications. It also means that it will be much easier to mathematically prove the correctness of projects built on it. These effects cannot be easily replicated in non-functional languages supported on other platforms.
1. ADA has claimed and maintained a spot in the top 10 cryptocurrencies for several years and now is in the top 5.
