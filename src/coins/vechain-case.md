## Overview

1. VeChain (VET) is a cryptocurrency that started by revolutionizing supply chain management world-wide. Currently, guaranteeing product quality and safety is extremely difficult and in many cases financially impossible in today's world. Fake or counterfeit products, sub-standard replacements, items past expiration, or other cheats are constant challenges for all involved. These challenge consumers, manufacturers, and regulators alike. The supply-chain industry desperately needs a better way to monitor, detect, and address such cheats both for intentional as well as accidental occurrences.
1. The initial use-case of VeChain allows suppliers to record and track the entire history of their products at every stage of production. This is done by issuing a digital tag for each individual product at the start of the product's creation. As the product is created/grown/baked/shipped/verified etc, an entry is made on VeChain for each stage of its development. All-in-all, this provides a complete and accurate history for a product - where it was shipped, how it was made, where components came from, guarantees on quality or anything else that companies choose to record on the blockchain. Finally, this history can be made available to customers as digital evidence towards the authenticity and quality of that product.
1. Each digital assentation of events following a tag is backed by a financial claim. If any inaccuracy, fraud, or error is later found in a validated chain of events, those responsible will lose a proportionally large amount of money on the VeChain network. This follows a model similar to how other oracles introduce external data into the blockchain. This ensures a high degree of reliability in all information stored. This innovation of counterfeit and fraud-resistant blockchain for enterprise is useful to many additional businesses.
1. VeChain is now focused on delivering a 2.0. VeChain has used the learnings from its past successes and broadened the scope of its blockchain to include most enterprise applications, regardless of their domain.
1. VeChainThor is it's upgraded native blockchain that includes an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that allows it to execute arbitrary smart contracts. This puts it in competition with general-purpose smart contract platforms with ETH, BNB, DOT, ADA, and others. However, unlike most others VeChain especially focuses on servicing enterprise-level customers. However, IBM, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are also working on products that compete more directly to service enterprise customers. To this end, VeChain has prioritized flexibility, speed and ease of development, a fast-moving governance structure, and simplifying compliance with future government regulations. All of these combined provide a platform that should cover the needs of many businesses.
1. VeChain's functional decentralized governance structure innovates decentralized governance to allow for speed of iteration while maintaining decentralized checks on power. It includes a Steering Committee (Board of Directors), Authority Masternodes (daily governing body), Economic X nodes (early token investors), and Economic Nodes (later token investors). Combined, it is able to efficiently gather input from each stakeholder in the VeChain community, but is still able to move quickly due to daily operational power being held by representative democracy electees.
1. VeChain in January 2021 released an early version of it's Sync 2 wallet. This was a remarkable innovation that allows users to directly utilize blockchain applications in their internet browser _without_ needing to own or even know about blockchain. Many projects can benefit from the Sync 2 wallet either directly or indirectly.
1. VeChain utilizes a unique two-token model for the financials of their network. VET is the main financial token of VeChain while VTHO is used exclusively to pay for transactions on VeChain. VTHO is generated automatically for VET holders up to a max limit. For most use cases, enough VTHO should be available for each business just by holding their target amount of VET tokens. By separating usage from speculation interests, VeChain is able to provide businesses with predictable and stable maintenance costs. This addresses a major concern of businesses with using blockchain directly.

## Major Bullish Arguments

1. VeChain has proven itself as a major contributor to the innovation of enterprise blockchain across all major domains. It has existing clients using its technology to solve real problems. Many complex problems facing the cryptocurrency ecosystem now have robust solutions implemented on VeChain.
1. VeChain has many existing and new partnerships with companies both within the cryptocurrency area and without. All of these participants are experimenting with and/or committing to trusting VeChain as their platform of choice for handling their businesses interests on blockchain.

## Major Counterarguments

1. Some of VeChain's "partnerships" have been found to be slightly exaggerated. A few companies have issued statements clarifying the status of their relationship with VeChain as slightly less committed than one can be led to believe by statements posted by VeChain or its community.
   - While this has happened in some cases, it does not seem to have been widespread; most claimed partnerships have appeared to be legitimate. It is very common in startups to have some corporate relationships described as slightly more intimate than the reality. Sometimes this is due to misinterpretation on the part of the community and others it can be a conscious exaggeration of the CEO. Most of the data needed to verify such statements is available publicly should concerns persist.
1. VeChain lacks a clear roadmap.
1. Proof of Authority (PoA) is less secure than other consensus algorithms, which could make VeChain more susceptible to malicious actors.
1. Proof of Authority (PoA) is less decentralized than Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, etc. This can make VeChain comparatively less resilient.
