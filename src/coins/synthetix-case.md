## Overview

1. Synthetix (SNX) is a decentralized protocol to bring financial derivatives to cryptocurrency. A derivative or synthetic asset is a [financial contract](https://www.thebalance.com/what-are-derivatives-3305833){target=\_blank} that allows the holder to purchase a specific asset at a specific date and price. These contracts can typically be traded much more easily than the underlying asset. Traditionally derivatives are especially used for trading commodities such as oil, but are now also used in many other additional markets.
1. The derivatives market is the largest financial market worldwide and estimated to be as large as a [quadrillion dollars](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/052715/how-big-derivatives-market.asp){target=\_blank}, though there is debate that the figure may be overestimated.
1. SNX derivatives eliminate individual counterparty risk. Instead, each individual SNX derivative asset is backed by the entire staked supply of SNX tokens. SNX is issued to or burned by stakers to maintain the target collateral level of their synthetic assets. Current asset prices are monitored by a decentralized system of oracles.
1. Synthetix contracts (Synths) are backed by severe over-collateralisation ratios. This over-collateralisation helps ensure solvency of all Synth contracts. Each is backed by of 750% of the native token SNX, and can be adjusted as needed via the decentralized governance mechanisms. Additional cryptocurrencies may also be allowed as collateral in the future to further mitigate solvency risk.
1. SNX currently supports commodities, fiat currencies, and cryptocurrency markets. These are tradeable on Synthetix's exchange Kwenta, as well as on other decentralized exchanges.
1. SNX is working on deploying many features in 2021. The project is working to launch on layer-2 Ethereum via optimism, which should reduce fees and allow more widespread participation. They are also working on V3 of their protocol, which is expected to bring futures contracts to cryptocurrency. Finally, they are also working to launch support for equities derivatives as well. This would allow anyone to get synthetic exposure to global equity markets regardless of jurisdiction.
1. The Synthetics protocol is built on Ethereum and is used by many other projects in DeFi. It is one of the most used protocols on Ethereum, with over $2 billion locked in contracts already.
1. The Synthetix protocol is implementing a robust decentralized governance mechanism to decrease centralized risk. It aims to become more self-sustaining and completely run by its community.

## Major Bullish Arguments

## Major Counterarguments

1. Cryptocurrency is much easier to trade freely than most assets and is becoming even easier all the time. This may decrease the total demand for trading derivatives rather than using the underlying asset directly.
